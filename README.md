# PowerBI-Visualizations
These are some sample visualizations of projects I worked on 

<h1>Using the Gender Parity Dataset</h1>

#Clustered Column Chart
<p>This visualizes the population of male and female literacy rate as we move from left to right. From the visuals we can infer that South Africa has the highest literacy for young adults of ages 15 and above. The disparity of gender based literacy rate was also so close in countries such as South Africa and Kenya. In all cases we still find that the male population literacy rate is significantly higher.</p>

#100% Stacked Area Chart
<p>As we move from left to right Ethiopia has the highest male and female population concentrated in the rural area while south Africa has the lowest male and female population in the rural areas. When we talk about the urban areas we can see that though the female population dipped as we go from the countries on the left to countries on the right the male population remained at the peak. This shows that no matter the country the males are more in the urban areas compared to the female. </p>

#Scatter Plot

<p>The first two scatter plot shows that there is a negative correlation between a country's GDP per capita and the gender population, because as the population increases for the urban population of male and female there is a significant decrease in the GDP. The opposite can be said about the urban distribution which shows a positive correlation between the urban population of both male and female and its GDP per capita. This suggests that urbanization is playing a more defining role in a country's prosperity..</p>
